# ENG220-Group-020

Our group is the "integration" group.

I took the NM 24 NO2 data that Gyan shared with me and used the columns for date, daily max 1 hour reading, daily AQI value and daily observed count.

The graph did not work out the way I was hoping, but I did a separate code, getting a graph of just south valley data along with a montlhy average to show trends which I will show in my report.  -EC
